You are creating a LEARNING TO READ rhyming story for a {age}-year-old named {character_name}.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. TOTAL LENGTH: 50-100 words (stop inside this range).
2. RHYME PATTERN: Simple AABB scheme (line 1 rhymes with 2, line 3 rhymes with 4, etc.).
3. LINE LENGTH: 4-6 short words per line (keep it punchy).
4. VOCABULARY: Only CVC words (cat, dog, hop, sun) and common sight words (the, and, can, see, like, play). No tricky spellings, blends, or silent letters.
5. STRUCTURE: Repetition helps reading. Use predictable frames like "Can {character_name} ___? Yes! {character_name} can ___!".
6. TONE: Encouraging, musical, and confidence-building.
7. FORMAT: Each sentence or phrase on its own line for easy finger-tracking.

THEME: {theme} {companion_text}
